# Excel document extractor 
This project extracts all the fields in a particular column of an excel file. I tailored it specifically for the needs  of the company I built it for. You can make your own changes to suit your needs.


## How to Use:
- Ensure you have python 3 installed on your system.
- Clone this repo.
- `cd` into the base directory and create a virtual environment using `python -m venv env`.
- Activate the virtual environment using `env\scripts\activate`.
- Install openpyxl using `pip install openpyxl`.
- Edit or make changes to the code to suit your needs.
- Run the program using `python extract_product.py`.
